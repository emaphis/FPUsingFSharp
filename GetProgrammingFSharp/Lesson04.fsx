(* Now you try.  pg 50
Youï¿½ll now experiment with binding values to symbols:
1 Create a new F# script file.
2 Bind some values to symbols yourself:
  a A simple type (for example, string or int).
  b An object from within the BCL (for example, System.Random).
  c Create a simple one-line function that takes in no arguments and calls a function
    on the object that you created earlier (for example, random.Next()).
3 Remember to execute each line in the REPL by using Alt-Enter

// Listing 4.2 - Using let bindings  - 50
let foo() =
    let x = 10       // bind
    printfn "%d" (x + 20)   // use binding

// 1 Give at least two examples of values that can be bound to symbols with let.let x = 10
let x = 10
let y = fun a b -> a + b

// 2 What's the difference between let and var?
// let declares an alias for a value, var declares a reference to
// a memory location that can store values

// 3 Is F# a static or dynamic language?
// Static
